# covid-vaccine-database

The domain of our application is public health management related to Covid-19. 

The aspects of public health we will be modelling is Covid-19 testing and vaccination centres and their patients. The database allows the government to keep track of the vaccination status of its citizens and allows citizens to book a vaccination appointment at their nearest vaccination centre. 

Our application will include a login page for different users. There will be two two classes of users for our system: the government facility and the patient. 

Government facilities can access patient information to see who has been vaccinated, their dose number, and their inventory of vaccines. The government facilities will be able to access information about vaccine status of individuals and their personal information. Government facilities will also have the authority to manage information such as viewing their vaccine inventory and appointment bookings, by adding, updating, deleting data in the database.

Patients can use the database to look for their nearest testing/vaccination center to easily book their appointment. The patients will be able to access the information about all testing centers and places to get vaccines. Patients can book their testing and vaccination appointment through this webpage by logging into their account. They can also update and change their password.

Only government accounts can change a patient’s vaccination status, dose number, and vaccine. 

This project uses MySQL database system, PHP, and HTML. We don’t expect to use any extra software or hardware.
